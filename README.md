Gamecontroller.js is a small layer on top of HID to interact with any USB game controller, like Sony PlayStation, XBOX, SNES, ... with node.js, depending on a small config for each controller only.



Installation
===

Installing node-gamecontroller is as easy as cloning this repo or use npmjs:

```bash
npm install gamecontroller
```

Usage
===

Plug in your game controller and run the following code:

```js
const Gamecontroller = require('gamecontroller');
const ctrl = new Gamecontroller('ps2');

ctrl.connect(function() {
    console.log('Game On!');
});

ctrl.on('X:press', function() {
    console.log('X was pressed');
});

ctrl.on('X:release', function() {
    console.log('X was released');
});
```

To get the full parsed HID data stream, you can run

```js
ctrl.on('data', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

Supported Events
===

Data
---

- `data`- Get parsed data as it comes in

Supported Controllers
===

At the moment, the following controllers are supported:

- Playstation 2 Ripoff ("ps2")
- XBOX 360 ("xbox360")
- Tomee SNES Controller ("snes-tomee")
- Retrolink SNES Controller ("snes-retrolink")

If you've connected a supported controller, you can run the following to find the name of it:

```js
var Gamecontroller = require('gamecontroller');

var dev = Gamecontroller.getDevices();

console.log(dev);
```

Adding new controllers
===

If your controller isn't supported yet, add the config to the `lib/vendor.js` file and send a pull request or file a bug ticket. To get all the information follow the following simple steps. Run the following snippet, locate your controller and note the vendorId and productId:

```js
var HID = require('node-hid');
console.log(HID.devices());
```

Using the vendorId and productId you can run the following snippet, press all the keys on your controller and get the array position of what key changes what array index:

```js
var hid = new HID.HID(vendorId, productId);
hid.on("data", function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```
